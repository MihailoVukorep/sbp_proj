Performance Analysis and Optimization Guide

OVERVIEW
========
This v2 version implements schema optimization and targeted indexing for 5 key analytical queries.

QUERY ANALYSIS
==============

QUERY 1: Average revenue per company (budget > 50M)
---------------------------------------------------
Original bottleneck:
  - Full collection scan for budget > 50000000
  - Unwind operation on production.companies array
  - Multiple aggregation stages without index support
  
Optimization:
  - Computed field: budget_category (low/medium/high/blockbuster)
  - Index: (budget_category, companies)
  - Fast categorical filtering instead of range comparison
  
Expected improvement: 70-85% faster


QUERY 2: Average rating per genre by decade
---------------------------------------------
Original bottleneck:
  - Decade calculation in aggregation pipeline
  - Nested date structure (release_info.release_date.year)
  - Unwind on genres without index support
  - Grouping on two dimensions
  
Optimization:
  - Computed field: decade at release_info level
  - Index: (decade, genres, vote_average)
  - Eliminates arithmetic in pipeline
  
Expected improvement: 75-90% faster


QUERY 3: Months with most blockbuster movies (budget > 100M)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Original bottleneck:
  - Range query on budget without index
  - Month extraction from nested date structure
  - Grouping by month field at 3 levels deep
  
Optimization:
  - Computed field: budget_category (blockbuster = budget >= 100M)
  - Denormalized field: month at release_info level
  - Index: (budget_category, month)
  - Categorical lookup instead of range scan
  
Expected improvement: 80-90% faster


QUERY 4: Most profitable genre combinations
---------------------------------------------
Original bottleneck:
  - Genre pair generation in pipeline (extremely slow)
  - Profit/ROI calculation at runtime
  - No index for grouping by combinations
  - Multikey index on genres insufficient
  
Optimization:
  - Computed field: genre_pairs (all 2-combinations precomputed)
  - Computed fields: profit, roi, is_profitable
  - Index: genre_pairs (multikey)
  - Index: (genre_pairs, roi) for sorting
  - Eliminates expensive algorithm from pipeline
  
Expected improvement: 85-95% faster (most dramatic)


QUERY 5: Average runtime per country (rating > 7, 100+ movies)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Original bottleneck:
  - Range query on vote_average without index
  - Unwind on production.countries without index
  - Two-pass aggregation (group then filter)
  - No index optimization
  
Optimization:
  - Computed field: quality_tier (excellent = vote_average >= 7.0)
  - Index: (quality_tier, countries, runtime)
  - Categorical filtering instead of range comparison
  - Single-pass aggregation
  
Expected improvement: 70-85% faster


COMPUTED FIELDS REFERENCE
==========================

decade
  Calculation: (year // 10) * 10
  Purpose: Group movies by decade without pipeline calculation
  Used by: Query 2
  
budget_category
  Values: 'low' (<10M), 'medium' (10-50M), 'high' (50-100M), 'blockbuster' (>=100M)
  Purpose: Fast categorical filtering instead of range queries
  Used by: Queries 1, 3, 4
  
quality_tier
  Values: 'poor' (<5.0), 'average' (5-6), 'good' (6-7), 'excellent' (>=7.0)
  Purpose: Pre-categorize quality for fast filtering
  Used by: Query 5
  
profit
  Calculation: revenue - budget
  Purpose: Avoid calculation in aggregation pipeline
  Used by: Query 4
  
roi
  Calculation: ((revenue - budget) / budget) * 100
  Purpose: Pre-calculate ROI for sorting and filtering
  Used by: Queries 1, 4
  
is_profitable
  Calculation: profit > 0
  Purpose: Boolean index for fast filtering
  Used by: Query 4
  
genre_pairs
  Calculation: All 2-combinations of genres sorted alphabetically
  Format: ['Action+Drama', 'Action+Sci-Fi', 'Drama+Sci-Fi']
  Purpose: Eliminate expensive pair generation in pipeline
  Used by: Query 4


INDEXES SUMMARY
===============

Query 1 indexes:
  - idx_budget_companies: Primary (budget_category, companies)
  - idx_budget: Fallback for direct budget queries
  - idx_budget_roi: For sorting results

Query 2 indexes:
  - idx_decade_genre_rating: Primary (decade, genres, vote_average)
  - idx_decade: For decade-only queries

Query 3 indexes:
  - idx_blockbuster_month: Primary (budget_category, month)
  - idx_budget_month: Fallback (budget, month)

Query 4 indexes:
  - idx_genre_pairs: Primary multikey index
  - idx_genre_pairs_roi: For sorting
  - idx_profitable_profit: Additional filtering

Query 5 indexes:
  - idx_quality_countries_runtime: Primary (quality_tier, countries, runtime)
  - idx_rating_countries: Fallback (vote_average, countries)
  - idx_vote_average: For rating-only queries

Additional:
  - idx_text_search: Full-text search on title and overview


SCHEMA CHANGES
==============

release_info structure:
  Before: year/month/day inside release_date subdocument
  After: year, month, day, decade at top level of release_info
  Benefit: Faster field access, smaller prefixes for indexes

financial structure:
  Added: profit, roi, is_profitable, budget_category
  Benefit: Eliminates runtime calculations

ratings structure:
  Added: quality_tier
  Benefit: Fast categorical filtering

content_info structure:
  Added: genre_pairs
  Benefit: Precomputed combinations avoid pipeline algorithm

production structure:
  Added: company_count, country_count
  Benefit: Quick access to cardinality


MIGRATION GUIDE
===============

To migrate from v1 to v2:

1. Run init_db.py to load data with new schema:
   python init_db.py

2. Run queries.py to create indexes and test performance:
   python queries.py

3. Validate schema version:
   db.movies.findOne() should show schema_version: 2

4. Compare performance with v1 baseline


PERFORMANCE METRICS
===================

Estimated time improvements (compared to v1):

Query 1: 70-85% faster
  - Budget filtering now O(log n) instead of full scan
  - Index covers both filter and group key

Query 2: 75-90% faster
  - Decade extraction eliminated from pipeline
  - Index covers filter, group, and sort

Query 3: 80-90% faster
  - Budget category filtering is categorical lookup
  - Month at top level reduces nesting depth

Query 4: 85-95% faster
  - Genre pairs precomputed (biggest improvement)
  - Eliminates expensive nested loop algorithm
  - All filtering and grouping covered by indexes

Query 5: 70-85% faster
  - Quality tier filtering is O(log n)
  - Runtime metric included in index


MAINTENANCE
===========

Indexes require periodic maintenance:
- Monitor index size with db.movies.aggregate([{$indexStats: {}}])
- Rebuild if fragmentation detected: db.movies.reIndex()
- Update statistics if query plans change

Computed fields are generated during insert/update:
- No background processing required
- Storage overhead: ~15-20% per document
- Worth the trade-off for query performance


LIMITATIONS
===========

- Genre pairs limited to 2-combinations (extensible if needed)
- Budget categories are static (can be made configurable)
- Quality tiers based on vote_average only
- No TTL or archival strategy implemented
- Full-text index requires English stemming


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
====================

1. Materialized views for pre-aggregated results
   - company_stats collection
   - genre_decade_stats collection
   - country_stats collection

2. Partial indexes for specific subsets
   - Only blockbuster movies
   - Only profitable movies
   - Only high-quality movies

3. Covered queries
   - Store all query fields in index projection
   - Eliminate document fetch overhead

4. Pipeline optimization
   - Move $match before $unwind
   - Use $facet for multiple aggregations
   - Early $project to reduce document size
